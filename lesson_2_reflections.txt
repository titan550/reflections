what happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
if you do this, you get a .git folder in the directory and git initializes
its files and gets ready for commits.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
you might want to edit only some of the files and put them in a commit
and you don't want other files to be involved.
