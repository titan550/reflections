When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when collaborating with others and/or using multiple machines to develop a code.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
sometimes you are not sure about your commits and if you want to publish and share them with others.
sometimes you might be offline working on a project.
