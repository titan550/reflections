When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when collaborating with others and/or using multiple machines to develop a code.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
sometimes you are not sure about your commits and if you want to publish and share them with others.
sometimes you might be offline working on a project.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork is cloning a repository and deattaching from the source. while clone is done locally, fork is over github.
you make a branch for an existing project in which you will eventually merge branches.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
it makes it easier to revert while working on a project offlince. in case you mess up, you can
evert back to a working state. #protection



How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
it is gonna be much more difficult without github



When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
this way you can better collaborate and offer changes to the master without directly changing it without prior notice.
